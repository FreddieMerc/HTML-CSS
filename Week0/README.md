### Getting ready for Javascript
To get an easier start with learning javaScript later on look into [Javascript fundamentals](http://javascript.info/). 

### Install the Slack Apps on your:
- Mobile: [App store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=nl)
- Desktop: [OSX](https://slack.com/downloads/osx) or [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)

### Join:

- GitHub: https://www.github.com
- Slack: https://hackyourfuture-cph.slack.com/signup

Once you are in, join the channel #class{your class number} and write "hej ðŸ‘‹".
So if your classnumber is 21 the Slack channel will be called #class21. <br>

We also ask you not to use fake names - as you will use this channel for advice and feedback it will be helpful if your mentors know who is who. Adding a photo to your profile is also recommended :)

- How to format your messages in Slack: [Using Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages)


### Check double check:

### Are you signed up for:

- Slack
- Github

### Did you do the following?:

- Write "hallo :hand:" in Slack?
- Did you install the Slack app on your mobile AND your computer?
- Did you create a Github account?

>If the answer to this is 'no', don't panic, you can always ask help in Slack, but before you do, please first try and see if you can find some information about the above tools yourself (hint: ask Google first).

### Do you have a text editor installed?

Any of the ones listed below is fine.
- [Visual studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime (not free)](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

If you have no experience or preference when it comes to working with text editor just install Visual studio, you can always switch to another editor later on in the program.

### Curriculum
Don't forget to take a look at the [HackYourFuture Denmark curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-cph/curriculum). Go through it and make sure you have an idea of what you will learn at HackYourFuture :muscle:
